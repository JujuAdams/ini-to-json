A no-code-required JSON replacement for the native GameMaker .ini handling functions.

Import the .yymp package (see above) and that's it! All `ini_*` function calls will be replaced with JSON equivalents on compile.

**How do I import this library into my game?**

GameMaker Studio 2.2.3 allows you to import assets, including scripts and shaders, directly into your project via the "Local Package" system. From the [Releases](https://github.com/JujuAdams/ini-to-json/releases) tab for this repo, download the .yymp file for the latest version. In the GMS2 IDE, load up your project and click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu then import all scripts and shaders from the Scribble package.
